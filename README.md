# Python Monthly Website
The python monthly website will be the home of python monthly. It will be home to all the python monthly meetings and will also hold the following: 
  - Archive of videos
  - keynotes (if allowed)
  - blog posts of lessons learned while working on the projects

### Working on the website
I encourage you to [join our slack team](https://jay400.typeform.com/to/tfYA6n) where we talk about the project in our `#pm-website-project`.
Of course you can submit issues and pull requests without that just be sure that you are using the Git Branch Workflow (not sure what that is check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_YRki7aTk&list=PLyLTyCCJDTTdcc9faHmUAuhOQalSdYt_j&index=6)) 

## Pelikan
